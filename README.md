Just wrote my first line of PHP two days ago, and here's my first project! Simple todo app with a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database (this is coincidentally also my first SQL project). You can add new tasks, mark tasks complete, "uncomplete" tasks, and delete them, too. The task list is arranged so that incomplete tasks show up first; incomplete tasks are then arranged in descending order of creation date, and completed tasks are arranged in descending order of _completion_ date.

This project also uses [prepared statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement) to guard against SQL injection.

Hope you enjoy this demo, and [let me know](https://tymick.me/connect) if you have any questions!

Sincerely,
